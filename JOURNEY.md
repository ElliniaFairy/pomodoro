# 🚀 Cosmic Pomodoro Timer - Development Journey

## Original Prompt

I want a pomodoro timer which allow to:
- Set a default focus time to 36 minutes, but I can click it to change the setting. change it at the setting.
- It is a countdown clock with fancy UI. I would really love to grid-based block-eating progress bar cell-filling progress bar (like the disk defragmenter progress animation)
- Start at the middle of a pomodoro that I forgot to press the start button (for example, I started a pomodoro at 18:14 but only until 18:25 does I noticed that I need to start pomodoro at 18:14, so I can enter 18:14 to start and it only gives me 25 minutes, just like I started at that time). If only until 19:00 I realized it, I can still choose to start the pomodoro at 18:14. In which case, a default 3 minutes countdown will be shown (in progress bar, it is 46/49 min), and when the 3 minutes complete, the 49 minutes session will be recorded.
- I also want to adjust the timer during or even after a focus/break time. Like, I maybe too focus to realize that the focus session is done 10 minutes ago (from 19:05-19:41 and now it is 19:55) so I want a button reset the pomodoro to end at +3 minutes (and any minute) from now to rap up. In case that, for example, it is 19:55 now but I started the timer from 19:05, and the timer has stopped but the break timer is yet started, then I can set another 3 minutes (even can set any minutes) from now and the record would be like 19:05-19:58.
- Can stop at anytime and the record will be recorded unless it is less than 2 minutes.
- Can modify the current session remaining time at any point, including the break time and focus time.
- I also want to, instead of a fixed break time, always introduce the 1/3 of the focus time for break time. But I can also extended the break time during the break session.
- I will have all the record today with a really fancy dashboard, even the heat map feature.
- I have an experience bar which allows to level up. If I get pomodoro streak in less than 3 hours, or the first time of the day I could have bonus point. If I get pomodoro every streak (2/3/4/5/...days) I also get bonus point.
- For each focus time I want to record the contents of what task did I do in that focus session.
